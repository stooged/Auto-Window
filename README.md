# Auto Window

`Archiving old project`


when you goto install the box into the car the only wire you need to cut is the light blue wire in the small connector.<br>

the "switch" side of the light blue wire connects to the control box's "12v+ Window Up Switch" wire<br>
the harness side of the light blue wire connects to the "window Up Motor" wire<br>

you dont need to cut any other wires, you just tap into the other wires.<br>


NOTE:<br>

for the 12v+ Constant power make sure you use the "green" wire from the window switch's large connector, dont connect it to the battery etc.<br>

you cant just use normal 12v relays you need to use back a emf protected circuit for the relays as the emf will cause the mainboard to have adverse effects<br>
the jaycar part XC4440 is back emf protected and only costs $12.<br>



to start the auto up function just hold the window switch up for 1 second and auto up will begin.<br>
to stop the auto up say like half way just tap the window down switch quickly and the auto up will stop<br>
