# Auto Window

`Archiving old project`


when you goto install the box into the car the only wire you need to cut is the light blue wire in the small connector.

the "switch" side of the light blue wire connects to the control box's "12v+ Window Up Switch" wire
the harness side of the light blue wire connects to the "window Up Motor" wire

you dont need to cut any other wires, you just tap into the other wires.


NOTE:

for the 12v+ Constant power make sure you use the "green" wire from the window switch's large connector, dont connect it to the battery etc.

you cant just use normal 12v relays you need to use back a emf protected circuit for the relays as the emf will cause the mainboard to have adverse effects
the jaycar part XC4440 is back emf protected and only costs $12.



to start the auto up function just hold the window switch up for 1 second and auto up will begin.
to stop the auto up say like half way just tap the window down switch quickly and the auto up will stop
